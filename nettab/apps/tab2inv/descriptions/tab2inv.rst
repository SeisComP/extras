The tab2inv program is part of the nettab package distributed together with the
|scname| package. The nettab is a text-based format developed inside the
GEOFON data center to describe seismological instruments responses information.
The tab2inv program can generate |scname| inventory files by parsing
´´tab files´´ as described by in the nettab format.

This program can read a set of tab files in the nettab format,
verify their contents and generate inventory for the stations
described in them.
